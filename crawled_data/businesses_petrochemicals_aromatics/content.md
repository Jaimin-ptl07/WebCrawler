##  Aromatics 
Aromatics are cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbons containing one or more Benzene rings. Aromatics is one of the major product lines of our Petrochemicals sector.
We successfully commissioned our Paraxylene (PX) and Benzene facility in 2017. With this, our PX capacity is 4.6 MMTPA and Benzene capacity is 1.4 MMTPA. This takes our combined Xylenes and Benzene production capacity to 6 MMTPA. Further, our Aromatics business also consists of LAB production of 135 KTPA.
With our world-scale plants, we are a supplier of choice for our Indian and global customers.
##  Products 
#### Paraxylene
We are the 3rd largest producer of Paraxylene (PX) in the world, with aromatic plants spread across different locations.
Paraxylene is the building block for the entire polyester industry. It is processed to get Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) that is further processed to form polyester fibres/PET.
The aromatic complexes are located on the west coast of India, Patalganga, in the state of Maharashtra, and Jamnagar in the state of Gujarat. RIL also operates facilities of PTA at Hazira and Gandhar in the state of Gujarat that consumes PX. In addition to the captive consumption for PTA, RIL exports large quantities of Paraxylene to leading petrochemical companies in Asia from its facility based in Jamnagar.

#### Ortho Xylene
Ortho Xylene (OX) is the second largest of the three commercial isomers of xylene and has a sweet, aromatic smell. It is a colourless liquid with a characteristic odour. Ortho Xylene is mainly used in the production of Pthalic Anhydride (~90%). Other applications are in paints, fibreglass, polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), etc.
With our capacity of 525 KTA, we are among the top producers of Ortho Xylene in the world. OX is produced at our integrated refinery complex at Jamnagar, Gujarat. We have a leading position in India and export majorly to Asian countries.

#### Benzene
Benzene (C6H6) is an aromatic hydrocarbon and one of the primary chemical building blocks for the petrochemical industry. It is a by-product of the Refinery, Naphtha Cracker, Paraxylene and Steel plant processes. Benzene can be made by hydro dealkylation of Toluene. It is used to produce a number of petrochemical intermediates such as ethylbenzene for styrene production, cumene for phenol and acetone, cyclohexane and nitrobenzene.
We produce Benzene at three manufacturing sites: Jamnagar, Hazira and Baroda on the west coast of India. We produce high-purity Benzene at our manufacturing sites.
We are one of the largest global merchant exporters of Benzene and our current combined Benzene production capacity at Jamnagar, Hazira and Vadodara is 1.4 MMTPA. Our Benzene exports are to all the major customers in the US, Europe and Middle East.
We also produce about 100 KTA of TDI grade Toluene for the domestic market. We also make 50 KTA of Cyclohexane and a small quantity of PDEB for the domestic downstream industry as well as for export.

#### Linear Alkyl Benzene (LAB) and Paraffin (NP/HNP/LNP)
We are among the largest producers of Linear Alkyl Benzene (LAB) in the world, with a capacity of 135 KTA.
Our LAB plants are located at Patalganga, Maharashtra and Vadodara, Gujarat. Both plants are licenced with UOP HF-Alkylation Technology, which is a catalytic process to alkylate Benzene with linear olefins to form LAB. The unit has its own captive Normal Paraffin (NP) plant and also produces Heavy Normal Paraffin (HNP) and Light Normal Paraffins (LNP).
LAB is a key ingredient in the detergent industry. LAB is sulphonated to produce Linear Alkyl Benzene Sulphonic Acid (LABSA). LABSA is an anionic surfactant with molecules characterized by a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic group.
LABSA is the most widely consumed surfactant because it is relatively of low cost, good performance, and is environmentally friendly due to its biodegradability. LABSA is mainly used to produce household detergents including laundry powders, laundry liquids, dishwashing liquids and other household cleaners. It is also used in numerous industrial applications, including as a coupling agent, an emulsifier for agricultural herbicides, and emulsion polymerization.
We are a major global LAB producer catering to large global and domestic detergent brands and to individual sulphonators.
Paraffins are mainly used as a feedstock for LAB production. The other major application includes Chlorinated Paraffin Wax (CPW), lubricating oil, cutting and rolling mill oil (Metal Working Fluid), and as a chemical solvent.
