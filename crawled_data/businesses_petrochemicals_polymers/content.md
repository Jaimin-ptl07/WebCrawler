##  Polymers 
We offer a wide range of grades for diverse applications across sectors such as packaging, agriculture, automotive, housing, healthcare, water and gas transportation, and consumer durables. Our products are exported to more than 70 countries.
**Circular polymers**
We are developing commercial scale continuous catalytic pyrolysis technology. The process has been successfully demonstrated at pilot scale.
This can convert unsegregated mixed waste plastics into Pyrolysis Oil, which will be processed at the refinery. Credits can be attributed to various petrochemicals as per International Sustainability and Carbon Credit (ISCC) plus mass balance certification to create circular products.
These products are in demand from multinationals to fulfil statutory requirements and keep their commitment to plastic circularity. We plan to scale up this production to promote plastic circularity.

##  Products 
####  Repol [PP] 
Reliance’s plants employ Spheripol and Adipol technologies from Basell and Unipol Process of Dow Chemicals for manufacturing different grades of Repol, which are exported to more than 30 countries. Products manufactured include homopolymer, random copolymer and impact copolymer.
Homopolymer is available in a wide range of melt flows and is designed to suit the requirements of various applications such as injection and blow moulding, Inflated Polypropylene (IPP) and Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene (BOPP) films, woven sacks, Flexible Intermediate Bulk Containers (FIBC) and fibres.
Random copolymer grades are designed to meet critical requirements of injection and blow-moulded clear containers, pipes and fittings and Injection Stretch Blow Moulding (ISBM) bottles.
Impact copolymer grades are tailored to meet the requirements of various applications such as automotive, appliances, furniture, paint pails, caps and closures, luggage, crates and compounding.

####  Relene [PE] 
Relene has transformed the concept of packaging with a wide range of applications - from woven sacks, milk packs, and oil packs to wire ducts.
Reliance's technology for manufacturing Polyethylene (PE) includes DuPont’s world-class "Sclairtech" Solution Polymerisation and also technologies from Basell, Ineos, Polymeric Europa, and Total Petrochemicals.
Reliance produces the entire range of Polyethylene with international standards and exports them to countries in Europe, Africa, Middle East, and Southeast Asia.
Reliance Polymers offers the entire range of Polyethylene (PE) – High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Linear Low-density Polyethylene (LLDPE) and Low-Density Polyethylene (LDPE).
HDPE grades are specially designed to meet demanding applications such as high-pressure pipes, telecom ducts, carrier bags, woven sacks, and injection and blow-moulded products. LLDPE grades are used extensively in speciality films, milk and edible oil packaging, lamination films, cast films, stretch films and other applications such as rotational moulding and injection-moulded products. LDPE grades are used in heavy-duty films, lamination films, extrusion coating and moulding applications.

####  RelWood™ 
RelWood™, an innovation brought to India by Reliance, promises to help save the environment around us. It looks like wood, feels like wood, can be worked upon like wood, but is tougher and greener.
RelWood™ is a natural fibre polymer composite material which can give the look and feel of wood while overcoming its drawbacks. Made with German technology, it has a unique homogeneous bonding between natural fibre and polymer. This creates a material that is virtually indistinguishable from tropical wood in terms of optics and haptic properties and at the same time is resistant to water, sun, wind and cold and does not splinter – even after many years. It is 100% recyclable, waterproof, low maintenance and is also resistant to termites, mould and fungi.
RelWood™ is available in the form of sheets (RelWood™ UPB) and also in profiles of various shapes and can be used in a variety of applications like furniture, door, flooring, decking, wall cladding or façade.
