All of us as humanity have only one planet. There is No Planet B. The only planet in the entire universe which is home to human life and to countless other living species is planet Earth and planet Earth is facing an existential crisis because of climate change. The Climate crisis is essentially Energy crisis. The excessive use of fossil fuels in the past two hundred years has gravely endangered the fragile ecology of the planet.
