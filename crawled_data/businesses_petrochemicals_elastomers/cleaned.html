<h4>
						Polybutadiene Rubber
			 </h4>
<p>Polybutadiene Rubber (PBR), or simply Butadiene Rubber, is one of the oldest offerings of Relflex Elastomers. Marketed under the brand name Relflex Cisamer, it is an international quality product with high cis content, high elasticity, and resistance to dynamic stress, thus ensuring longer product durability.</p>
<p>The quality of Relflex Cisamer PBR is benchmarked with global manufacturers linked to the standards of International Institute of Synthetic Rubber Producers (IISRP). World-class manufacturing facilities (Cobalt and Nickel grades) are located at Vadodara, Gujarat, with a combined capacity of 80,000 metric tonnes per year.</p>
<p>A state-of-the-art Nickel/Neodymium-based swing plant with a capacity of 40,000 metric tonnes per year has been commissioned at Hazira, Gujarat, thus making Relflex a unique brand that offers Cobalt, Nickel and Neodymium-based synthetic grades.</p>
<p>Major applications for PBR include tyre treads, tyre carcass and sidewalls, under-treads, cycle tyres, conveyor belts, sportswear, golf balls, automotive components, conveyor belts, and shoe heels and soles. PBR is also well-suited for the production of flexible rollers and mechanical goods due to its superior elasticity, resilience, and abrasion properties.</p>

<h4>
						Styrene Butadiene Rubber
			 </h4>
<p>Stylamer is emulsion grade Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR) from Relflex’s elastomer range. SBR is one of the highest consumed synthetic rubbers in the world due to its versatility, enhanced abrasion resistance, and low rolling resistance.</p>
<p>The Relflex Stylamer SBR plant is located in Hazira in the state of Gujarat, India. This plant has a capacity of 150 KT per annum and offers the complete range of dry and oil extended grades. It is integrated with the captive butadiene feed that is extracted from the petrochemical complex which is on site.</p>
<p>E-SBR is a versatile product and is used in wide spectrum of applications. Some of the major applications of E-SBR include passenger car and light truck tyres and truck tyre retreads. It is also preferred in applications such as conveyor belts, shoe soles, V-belts, moulded rubber goods, etc. It is also extensively used in the manufacturing of other products such as extruded gaskets, hoses, brake and clutch pads, automobile mats, flooring, rubber toys, food packaging, adhesives and chewing gum, among others.</p>

<h4>
						Butyl Rubber
			 </h4>
<p>Butyl Rubber is a synthetic rubber, a copolymer of isobutylene with isoprene. The product is impermeable to air and used in many applications requiring an airtight rubber. Butyl Rubber has good flex properties, resulting from low levels of unsaturation between long poly-isobutylene segments. It also has a high level of heat resistance and excellent low-temperature flexibility.</p>
<p>Butyl Rubber is used in the manufacture of tyre inner liners, automotive tubes, pharmaceutical closures, ball bladders, adhesives, sealants, vibration mounts, electrical fluids and lubricants among others.</p>
