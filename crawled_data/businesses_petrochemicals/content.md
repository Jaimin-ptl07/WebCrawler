#  Petrochemicals 
### Making more than just materials Creating chemistry for smiles
Our journey to help India meet its ever-growing needs began with textiles. Our aim was to bring affordable fashionable clothing to every Indian. It was a mission to go beyond just producing fabrics.
And so, we launched the legendary clothing and apparel brand “Only Vimal”.
Then from textiles, we kickstarted our backward integration journey by expanding to petrochemicals and then to refining and marketing.
We became one of the first businesses to manage a fully integrated Oil-to-Chemicals (O2C) portfolio.
Our O2C business includes world-class assets comprising refinery, crackers, and downstream assets that are deeply and uniquely integrated, supported by best-in-class logistics and supply chain infrastructure.
We are one of the few companies globally with integration from oil to transportation fuels, polymers and elastomers, intermediates, and polyesters.
Our world-class refining and petrochemicals manufacturing assets are located at Jamnagar, Hazira, Dahej, Nagothane, Vadodara, Patalganga, Silvassa, Barabanki and Hoshiarpur as well as in Malaysia at Nilai, Melaca, and Kuantan.
The O2C business also includes our fuel retailing partnership with bp, called Reliance bp Mobility Limited (RBML) – operating under the Jio-bp brand – and Butyl Rubber JV with Reliance Sibur Elastomers Private Limited.
The integrated O2C business structure enables an integrated decision-making approach that helps optimise the entire value chain from crude to refining and petrochemicals to the B2B/B2C model.
Through our O2C business, we have focused on building new capacities, strengthening our existing positions, and making our refinery and petrochemical businesses among the largest, most integrated, and most competitive in the world.

##  Leading India into the circular economy 
With a focus on adopting principles of circular economy, we are working to secure the promise of a sustainable future for generations to come. Through our "green" fabrics, eco-friendly materials, and initiatives to recycle waste plastic and reduce carbon footprint, we are helping lead India towards a circular economy. We continue to develop a sustainable petrochemical business model by promoting circularity and sustainability across downstream businesses through industry-wide initiatives and various re-engineered materials.
