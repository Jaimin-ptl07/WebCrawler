##  Textiles 
From its plant at Naroda, Reliance spearheaded the manufacturing and marketing of the most iconic brand in the history of textiles in India: 'Vimal'.
Our manufacturing division at Naroda houses one of the largest and most modern textile complexes in the world, an achievement recognised by The World Bank.
Through Vimal, we brought in a new era in fabrics. Vimal became not only a flagship brand of Reliance but also one of the most trusted brands in the country. It is also the first major retail chain in the country.
We supply premium finished fabrics to prestigious brands and export to over 58 countries. We are also a major player in the global automotive furnishing business.
