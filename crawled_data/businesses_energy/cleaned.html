<h3>Energizing India’s growth story Leading the path towards sustainability</h3>
</figure>
<div>
<div>
<p>We care about helping India meet its ever-growing energy needs.</p>
<p>Our quest to make India energy sufficient led us on our backward integration journey from textiles to setting up the world’s largest integrated refinery complex at a single site in Jamnagar. It has transformed India from being a net importer of petroleum products to a net exporter. We further went on to explore and discover Oil &amp; Gas fields in deep-sea waters.</p>

<p>Reliance is now one of the largest Oil &amp; Gas Exploration and Production players in India with a balanced domestic conventional and unconventional hydrocarbons portfolio. Today, Reliance is among the first companies globally to adopt an Oil-to-Chemicals strategy to produce the chemical building blocks of a circular economy and integrate it with sustainable downstream derivatives, useful chemicals, and new materials. With its commitment to a clean and sustainable future, Reliance is taking steps to meet its net-zero carbon goals by 2035.</p>
