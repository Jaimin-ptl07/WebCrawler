####  End-to-end solar PV ecosystem 
We are constructing a fully integrated, end-to-end solar photovoltaics (PV) manufacturing ecosystem, which will be one of the largest, most technologically advanced, flexible, and most cost-competitive solar giga factories globally.
The Jamnagar solar PV and cell module factory will be the first-of-its-kind 'quartz-to-module' facility globally, with components from quartz to metallurgical silicon, polysilicon, and ingots/wafers, that will be integrated with cells and modules.
This will take us a step closer to our target of establishing and enabling at least 100 giga watts (GW) of solar energy by 2030.
####  Fuel cell system 
We are setting up a fuel cell giga factory for electricity and power generation. Fuel cells will progressively replace internal combustion engines. Fuel cell engines can power automobiles, trucks, and buses. They can also be used in stationary applications for powering data centres, telecom towers, emergency generators and micro grids and industrial equipment.
####  Battery giga factory 
We are also setting up a battery giga factory by 2026 for manufacturing battery chemicals, cells and packs, as well as containerised energy storage solutions and a battery recycling facility. We aim to produce Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) based solutions at world beating lifecycle costs and we are fast-tracking commercialisation of our sodium ion battery technology.
####  Electrolyser 
One of the most common methods of generating Green Hydrogen is by electrolysis of pure water through Electrolysers. Our electrolyser giga factory will manufacture modular electrolysers of the highest efficiency and lowest capital cost.
These can be used for captive production of green hydrogen for domestic use as well as for global sale.
####  Energy storage and Green Hydrogen production 
We are integrating energy storage with wind and solar power generation at mega-watt scale in Jamnagar to provide grid-connected, round-the-clock electricity. We will also deploy batteries at grid-scale to convert intermittently captured photons into electrons for captive requirements, as well as for India’s growing energy needs.
For large scale and cost-competitive Green Hydrogen production, we will leverage our solar and wind energy storage integrated manufacturing ecosystem and set up a fully integrated, automated giga-scale electrolyser manufacturing facility.
####  Power electronics 
One of the key components linking the entire value chain of green energy is affordable and reliable power electronics.
We are building significant capabilities in designing and manufacturing power electronics and software systems and integrating these with our capabilities of telecommunications, cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) platform.
We will build this through partnerships with leading global players to provide most affordable solutions, meeting global standards of performance, safety, and reliability.
####  Wind power generation 
We are pursuing wind power generation by developing a manufacturing ecosystem for cost-efficient wind power generation at giga scale.
Our foray into carbon fibre—which is a significant cost driver in manufacturing wind blades—lends a unique advantage to further integrate and reduce the cost of wind turbines. Further, we will partner with the world’s leading technology players in wind equipment manufacturing to deliver cost-efficient solutions.
#### Accelerating net-zero carbon with bio-energy 
Bio-energy will help replace fossil fuels with renewable alternatives to produce green fuels for power plants, industrial boilers, and transport sectors. Our target biofuels include Compressed Biogas (CBG), densified briquettes and pellets, Green Hydrogen, and bio-oils.
To accelerate our target of net-zero carbon by 2035, we are developing capabilities in bio-energy.
We are India’s largest bio-energy producer.
We have set up two demo units for Compressed Biogas (CBG) at Jamnagar and a commercial scale CBG plant at Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh—commissioned in a record 10 months.
We aim to utilise a share of surplus agro-waste to convert to various forms of bio-energy. We target to establish 100 CBG plants in the next five years, consuming 5.5 million tonnes of agro-residue and organic waste. This will mitigate ~2 million tonnes of carbon emissions and help produce 2.5 million tonnes of organic manure annually. We expect this to result in a reduction of 0.7 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) of imported liquefied natural gas.
