<h4>
						End-to-end solar PV ecosystem
			</h4>
<p>We are constructing a fully integrated, end-to-end solar photovoltaics (PV) manufacturing ecosystem, which will be one of the largest, most technologically advanced, flexible, and most cost-competitive solar giga factories globally.</p>
<p>The Jamnagar solar PV and cell module factory will be the first-of-its-kind 'quartz-to-module' facility globally, with components from quartz to metallurgical silicon, polysilicon, and ingots/wafers, that will be integrated with cells and modules.</p>
<p>This will take us a step closer to our target of establishing and enabling at least 100 giga watts (GW) of solar energy by 2030.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h4>
						Fuel cell system 
			</h4>
<p>We are setting up a fuel cell giga factory for electricity and power generation. Fuel cells will progressively replace internal combustion engines. Fuel cell engines can power automobiles, trucks, and buses. They can also be used in stationary applications for powering data centres, telecom towers, emergency generators and micro grids and industrial equipment.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h4>
						Battery giga factory
			</h4>
<p>We are also setting up a battery giga factory by 2026 for manufacturing battery chemicals, cells and packs, as well as containerised energy storage solutions and a battery recycling facility. We aim to produce Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) based solutions at world beating lifecycle costs and we are fast-tracking commercialisation of our sodium ion battery technology.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h4>
						Electrolyser
			</h4>
<p>One of the most common methods of generating Green Hydrogen is by electrolysis of pure water through Electrolysers. Our electrolyser giga factory will manufacture modular electrolysers of the highest efficiency and lowest capital cost.</p>
<p>These can be used for captive production of green hydrogen for domestic use as well as for global sale.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h4>
						Energy storage and Green Hydrogen production
			</h4>
<p>We are integrating energy storage with wind and solar power generation at mega-watt scale in Jamnagar to provide grid-connected, round-the-clock electricity. We will also deploy batteries at grid-scale to convert intermittently captured photons into electrons for captive requirements, as well as for India’s growing energy needs.</p>
<p>For large scale and cost-competitive Green Hydrogen production, we will leverage our solar and wind energy storage integrated manufacturing ecosystem and set up a fully integrated, automated giga-scale electrolyser manufacturing facility.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h4>
						Power electronics
			</h4>
<p>One of the key components linking the entire value chain of green energy is affordable and reliable power electronics.</p>
<p>We are building significant capabilities in designing and manufacturing power electronics and software systems and integrating these with our capabilities of telecommunications, cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) platform.</p>
<p>We will build this through partnerships with leading global players to provide most affordable solutions, meeting global standards of performance, safety, and reliability.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h4>
						Wind power generation
			</h4>
<p>We are pursuing wind power generation by developing a manufacturing ecosystem for cost-efficient wind power generation at giga scale.</p>
<p>Our foray into carbon fibre—which is a significant cost driver in manufacturing wind blades—lends a unique advantage to further integrate and reduce the cost of wind turbines. Further, we will partner with the world’s leading technology players in wind equipment manufacturing to deliver cost-efficient solutions.</p>

<h4>Accelerating net-zero carbon with bio-energy </h4>
<div>
<div>
<p>Bio-energy will help replace fossil fuels with renewable alternatives to produce green fuels for power plants, industrial boilers, and transport sectors. Our target biofuels include Compressed Biogas (CBG), densified briquettes and pellets, Green Hydrogen, and bio-oils.</p>
<p>To accelerate our target of net-zero carbon by 2035, we are developing capabilities in bio-energy.</p>
<p>We are India’s largest bio-energy producer.</p>
<p>We have set up two demo units for Compressed Biogas (CBG) at Jamnagar and a commercial scale CBG plant at Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh—commissioned in a record 10 months.</p>
<p>We aim to utilise a share of surplus agro-waste to convert to various forms of bio-energy. We target to establish 100 CBG plants in the next five years, consuming 5.5 million tonnes of agro-residue and organic waste. This will mitigate ~2 million tonnes of carbon emissions and help produce 2.5 million tonnes of organic manure annually. We expect this to result in a reduction of 0.7 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) of imported liquefied natural gas.</p>

						New Materials

<div>
<div>
<p>Consistent with our ambition to decarbonise our businesses and our vision for New Materials, we will build in phases India’s first and one of the world’s largest carbon fibre plants at Hazira with a capacity of 20,000 metric tonnes per annum (MTPA) based on Acrylonitrile feedstock.</p>
<p>Our carbon fibre platform will include carbon fibre and carbon fibre reinforced plastics. Our target is to be among the top three players globally in the carbon fibre and carbon fibre reinforced plastic composites.</p>
<p>Our foray into manufacturing carbon fibre at large scale also provides us with a unique advantage to integrate and reduce the cost of wind turbines, as carbon fibre is a significant cost driver in the manufacturing of wind blades.</p>
<p>We aim to complete the first phase of the carbon fibre plant during 2025. The plant will have flexibility to produce highly profitable specialty grades to cater to diverse end uses.</p>
<p>Besides other applications, carbon fibre composites are also used to meet the rapidly growing light weighting requirements of mobility and renewable energy. Thus, carbon fibre promises to be a multi-decade growth engine for our Oil-to-Chemicals business.</p>

<figure><img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/themes/custom/reliance/images/new_energy_img.jpg"/></figure><p>We are championing sustainability through circular economy and are India’s leader in recycling polyesters and plastics. We will strengthen our leadership position in PET recycling by more than doubling our bottle recycling capacity to 5 billion bottles a year.</p>
<p>We have developed an innovative chemical recycling pathway to enable conversion of waste plastics to valuable refinery feedstock.</p>
<p>Our scientists have also developed pathways to produce biodegradable and compostable plastics to completely replace single-use plastics. We are on our way towards attaining global leadership in recycling and producing sustainable materials.</p>
