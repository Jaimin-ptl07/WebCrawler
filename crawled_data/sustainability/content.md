### Securing our Shared Future on this Planet Transitioning India into an Ecological Civilization
The world is entering a New Energy era, which is going to be highly disruptive. The age of fossil fuels, which powered economic growth globally for nearly three centuries, cannot continue much longer.
The huge quantities of carbon emitted into the environment have endangered life on Earth.
Our world has only one option: rapid transition to a new era of green, clean, and renewable energy. The COVID-19 pandemic has further put the climate issue in the crisis bucket.
Therefore, the global new energy agenda needs to move from dialogue to action, from commitment to urgent implementation on the ground.
We realize that it is not enough to be carbon neutral; the world needs to achieve absolute reductions in emissions as soon as possible.
Each of our businesses, along with Reliance Foundation, has been wholeheartedly immersed in achieving ambitious targets in decarbonisation and caring for our people, our communities, and our planet.
Our vision is to help transition India and the world from an Industrial Civilization to an Ecological Civilization.
