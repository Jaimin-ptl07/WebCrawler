<p>The world is entering a New Energy era, which is going to be highly disruptive. The age of fossil fuels, which powered economic growth globally for nearly three centuries, cannot continue much longer.</p>
<p>The huge quantities of carbon emitted into the environment have endangered life on Earth.</p>
<p>Our world has only one option: rapid transition to a new era of green, clean, and renewable energy. The COVID-19 pandemic has further put the climate issue in the crisis bucket.</p>
<p>Therefore, the global new energy agenda needs to move from dialogue to action, from commitment to urgent implementation on the ground.</p>
<p>We realize that it is not enough to be carbon neutral; the world needs to achieve absolute reductions in emissions as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Each of our businesses, along with Reliance Foundation, has been wholeheartedly immersed in achieving ambitious targets in decarbonisation and caring for our people, our communities, and our planet.</p>
<p>Our vision is to help transition India and the world from an Industrial Civilization to an Ecological Civilization.</p>
