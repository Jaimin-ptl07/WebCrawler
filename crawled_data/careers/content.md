At Reliance Foundation Hospital (RFH) we bring together some of the world’s leading clinicians, most advanced technologies and compassionate caregivers to provide world-class care to patients. Our vision? To create a centre of excellence that is unparalleled in patient and caregiver experience. RFH is a technologically-advanced institution designed to international standards and the most stringent criteria in infrastructure, medical care, fire-safety, and environmental guidelines.
We also give our clinicians, nurses and clinical support staff all the support they need to ensure that patient care remains their top priority. I personally believe that if we consider patients as loved ones, we will easily achieve the best care possible! Every element at RFH – from premises to processes to professionals – contributes to our core principle: ‘Respect for Life’. Working at RFH has been a steep learning curve and has exposed me to an altogether different level and type of healthcare institution. The support I received in my early days at RFH is not only deeply inspiring, but also the kind a family provides to a new member. As a doctor and as a person, my mantra is and will always be ‘doing the right thing, in the right way’.

Whenever my friends ask me how my experience has been working at Reliance, I say, “It’s the best experience I’ve had working in India so far.” I say this having worked for over 15 years in the US and in several MNCs in India. When I joined Reliance eight years ago, I was part of Chairman’s Office – Special Assignments. Here, I got a vantage point into not just our own business but into the larger Indian economic landscape.
Projects that begin at Reliance have potentially national – even global – impact. I have never witnessed this astounding scale of impact in my previous organizations. But what makes my day-to-day work truly fulfilling is the culture of trust, autonomy, and challenge to take ownership that my leaders have nurtured. This reflects the working style that our Chairman also practices and encourages in all leaders. This expansive freedom based on trust is what makes working at Reliance not only excellent, but also meaningful.

Working at Reliance has been an emotional journey for me, one that deepens commitment. I hold a doctorate from University of York in language & linguistics, specializing in syntax and semantics, with a year researching and publishing computational corpus linguistics findings.
My work experience grew internationally across lecturing, discourse analysis, linguistic tech and published work. At Reliance, I found space and freedom to apply what I learned and grow it to a greater richness by sharing it. My effort has been to set the tone for engagement and communications, which are inextricably linked, and to evolve my craft from academic scholarship to real life solutions that engage minds.
The diversity here helped develop my communications repertoire over time across content-rich tracks that reveal our brand powerfully and operate on simple, effective cognition and linguistics principles. Reliance also offers a platform for ideation, one of my favourite spots. Today, Reliance’s ideation corpus is a goldmine for deep learning and future AI platforms!

At Reliance, the deep sense of achieving bigger objectives always prevails in my mind. I feel the energy and motivation embedded in the organization’s culture to continuously raise benchmarks and re-define the rules of business. Reliance’s focus on investing in people and empowering them continuously creates an atmosphere infused with commitment, creativity, growth and excellence. As an R&D and Intellectual Property professional, I get the opportunity to pursue goals despite challenging situations and convert the challenges into opportunities.
With sharp focus on innovation and improvement of products and processes, Reliance offers me ample opportunities to contribute across the value-chain in areas such as R&D project planning, R&D management platform development, designing and implementing organisation-wide IP policy, and framing an IP strategy & IP risk mitigation plan. My journey at Reliance has been very fulfilling so far, and I can tell it will be even more exciting and fulfilling in the years to come.

I am proud to be a part of India’s largest private sector organization. I am contributing to Reliance’s mission of value creation and positively impacting billions of people, which encourages me to put my best foot forward each day. My role entails identifying and engaging with the best talent, crafting career development programmes for our high calibre talent as well as fostering growth for employees. It is heartening to see youngsters so eager to have thriving careers with us and become leaders of ‘New Reliance’. Every day here is exciting and filled with challenges that fuel my learning appetite.
Reliance is truly entrepreneurial, promoting a culture of autonomy and ownership that continuously drives me to set new benchmarks. It is the perfect place for high achievers who challenge conventional wisdom and never say ‘never’!

Working in a fast-paced business role in Reliance has been a life-changing experience! We are in the process of scaling up our Carbon Fibre/Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CF/CFRP) vertical with world scale and best-in-class capital equipment. I have been fortunate to get involved in setting up this business from Day 1.
Additionally, a good grounding in corporate strategy during my initial years at RIL has helped me take forward only fit-for-purpose solutions which generate adequate societal and customer value.
In fact, on some days, the learning curve is so steep that I have started keeping a learning diary! In addition, working directly with the senior decision makers at Reliance has given me first-hand insight into how disruptions at scale can be planned and executed meticulously. I believe Reliance is a caring meritocracy which allows one to grow as a professional, a leader, and most importantly, as a person.
Reliance is my longest professional stint so far, and I am excited about the golden decade – for Reliance and for India.

At Reliance, our team works across a plethora of key sustainability issues impacting all sectors – energy, chemicals, retail, and digital services. To me, working at Reliance means scaling up our positive impact on the human and beyond human world alike. In an era where business sustainability is a worldwide priority, we have the freedom to utilize global skills in a local context and leapfrog into an innovative and more conscious way of doing business. Having worked globally in a niche space like sustainability, I continue to be excited by the seriousness and urgency with which Reliance responds to sustainable development opportunities.
My most cherished learning at Reliance has been to see the diversity in thought, generations and skills come together as ‘One Team’ to execute large projects in record time. Apart from a rewarding and purpose-driven career path, Reliance has also given me a platform to execute my ideas and help impact the lives of millions.

I started working in industrial biotechnology in Reliance Life Sciences and later moved to Reliance Industries Ltd. I have been steering the development of several bioprocesses to make biofuels, biopolymers and high value biochemicals. Contrary to common industry practices, Reliance gives a lot of freedom to experiment within the realms of a project, which really motivates one to excel. We are given a platform to flourish and encouraged to patent and publish our work - a major achievement for every scientist.
Being part of a company with very diverse businesses also provides exposure to areas over and above regular work. In addition, my mentors have always given me confidence to challenge the status quo. As a leader in biology, I can say with confidence that Reliance breaks the industry norm and empowers its employees to do the same.

What I’ve loved most about my time at Reliance is building consumer digital products that truly make a difference. The culture of ownership here has empowered me to drive projects with passion and creativity.
After nearly a decade at Apple in the USA, returning to India and working at Reliance has been profoundly enriching. The chance to work on large-scale projects at Jio and see our innovations drive real change is incredibly rewarding. The supportive and collaborative environment has made my journey both emotionally fulfilling and professionally exciting, reconnecting me with my roots and reinforcing my passion for meaningful work.
I’m deeply inspired by the idea that “What’s good for India is good for Reliance”. It is fulfilling to contribute to initiatives that positively impact the nation.

In my current role, I look at the entire Jio infra build life cycle pan India, from concept to commissioning, and now, operations support. I feel privileged to have contributed to India’s digital transformation in a way never imagined before.

This combination has created a leading example for other corporates to emulate.
