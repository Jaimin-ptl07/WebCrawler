###  RF helps women farmers improve their livelihoods 
RFIS in Sehore has supported women farmers of SHGs registered under Madhya Pradesh Rural Livelihood Mission (MPRLM) to fulfil the agenda of the state government’s organic farming mission. These women farmers are availing Reliance Foundation digital services through VMS, helpline number, WhatsApp groups and JioMeet app by attending and participating in various programmes and receiving useful advisories that they are applying on field to make their livelihood profitable and sustainable.
Durga Bai Malviya grew chilli plants on ten decimals of land. Her chilli crop was infected, and as result, the plant began to wilt. She was looking for information about organic remedy and called Reliance Foundation’s helpline number. She also posted pictures of her infected plants on the WhatsApp group called “Reliance Foundation – sustainable organic farming – Sehore” to discuss her issues. With expert advice on how to save her infected plants, Durga Bai not only sold her chilli produce, but also earned a profit.
Women farmers like Durga Bai and Manta Parmar, who farms brinjal plants, share, “Since we have adopted organic farming, our input costs have decreased. We regularly take information and advice from Reliance Foundation's helpline and feel that we are more self-reliant compared to before. Our family has also started supporting us in our endeavour. Our financial conditions have changed and we would like to thank Reliance Foundation for making our livelihood sustainable.”

Eight-month baby Malhar Karkare had severe shortage of oxygen in his blood due to Blue Baby Syndrome. When medications were not effective as desired, a complex heart surgery was performed. Baby Malhar was convalescing well for 6-8 hours following the procedure when he developed sudden cardiac arrest. All conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures began immediately and the chest cavity was opened for direct internal cardiac massage, which continued for 20 minutes with medical support.
Malhar bounced back and began to make a steady recovery. He was discharged without any neurological issues and with normal investigative reports. He is now on his way to being a spirited toddler.
A team led by Dr Shivaprakash Krishnanaik, Director, Paediatric Cardiac Sciences at RFH provided the medical care to Malhar.

###  Reliance Foundation Scholarships helps Sumitra Malagi realise her dreams 
Sumitra Malagi grew up in a modest background and knew early on that education was the only means of achieving success. After completing her bachelor’s degree, Sumitra worked as an Associate Network Infrastructure Engineer but soon realised that she needed to pursue a research-based Master’s programme in order to develop her skills in Artificial Intelligence (AI). She quit her job and decided to pursue a Master’s degree at IIT Hyderabad. That’s when she came to know about the Reliance Foundation Scholarships.
Sumitra applied and was interviewed for the Reliance Foundation Scholarship. She impressed the panellists with her excellent communication skills and sound understanding of AI/ML. “I was enthralled when I researched about my interviewer, I ecstatically told myself that I was interviewed by one of the most eminent data scientists of India (Dr. Shailesh Kumar) and that was quite an experience in itself and that I should not feel disheartened if I am not selected!”. 
Much to Sumitra’s delight, she was awarded a scholarship of Rs 6 lakhs for the duration of her PG programme. Sumitra speaks enthusiastically about the scholarship programme’s engagement and development sessions: “There are specially curated masterclasses and fireside chats throughout your tenure. You can also suggest topics which you want organised. The sessions are a mixture of inspiration, guidance and education. For instance, one of the webinars was on how AI is being used at Jio, it gave us a glimpse of real-world application of concepts we were studying as part of our courses”.

###  From struggle to success: The journey of Sukhbati Pal from Madhya Pradesh 
Sukhbati Pal, aged 56, lives with her husband in Shivpuri village of Tikamgarh District, Madhya Pradesh. They own only 0.5 acres of agricultural land without irrigation facilities.
Limited farm production compelled them to rely on wage labour, leaving them vulnerable due to age and health conditions. They struggled to meet household and health expenses with their inadequate income.
A glimmer of hope emerged when Pal started goat rearing. Although she had lost a couple of goats in the past, she regained confidence in 2023 after attending a**‘Pashu Pathshala’** (animal school), organised in collaboration with the Animal Husbandry department.
Pal learned scientific goat management and, with regular guidance from community support persons, increased her herd size from three to eleven goats.
She is now fully engaged in goat rearing and expects to earn an average annual income of Rs 45,000 from the sale of goats.
Sukhbati Pal is now a role model for other women in her village.
