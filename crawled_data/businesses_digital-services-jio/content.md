#####  THE DIGITAL LIFELINE OF INDIA 
Reliance Jio was launched in 2016 to empower every Indian with affordable access to a digital life—a gateway to the world—enabled with the world’s best digital technologies. Today, Jio has not only ushered in a digital revolution across India, in how Indians connect to the world, but also in how India will go on to shape the digital future.
India’s digital journey can be described in two eras: The era before Jio and the era after Jio. Before Jio’s launch, India ranked 155th in mobile data consumption. In less than a year after Jio’s launch, India catapulted to number ONE in the world in mobile broadband data consumption. Led by Jio, India has surpassed countries such as the USA and the UK in mobile data consumption.
Today, Jio is the largest operator in India and the 2nd largest single-country operator in the world, offering services such as connectivity, fibre, mobile devices, apps, and business solutions.
