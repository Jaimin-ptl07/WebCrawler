<h4>
						Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA)
			</h4>
<p>We are among the top 5 PTA producers in the world. Our world-class manufacturing technology and strategic interest in this business have helped us in our journey of growth.</p>
<p>Our PTA continues to be the raw material of choice among polyester manufacturers across India. RIL is the only Indian company to service domestic customers using all three mediums, i.e., tankers, 1.1 MT bags, and 50 kg bags. We also embarked on establishing a global PTA footprint by entering the exports market. We export to the Middle East, Africa and European regions.</p>
